# CNN Pruning Comparisons

The code for running the one-shot pruning algorithm can be seen in RunProject2.ipynb and the code for running the iterative magnitude pruning algorithm can be seen in RunProject2_2.ipynb.


To test the functioning of the code, run the Test.ipynb file. It runs the test.py file which runs all the implementations of the pruning algorithms for all the three sparsity ratios of 50%, 75% and 90%. The final results can be seen in the same ipynb notebook itself.
